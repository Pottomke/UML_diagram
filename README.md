# ATM activity diagram

## Story

You have now mastered the basics of UML activity diagram creation. Activity Diagrams describe how activities are coordinated to provide a service. Activity Diagrams consist of activities, states and transitions between activities and states. You can use activity diagram to model the logic of a single use case, or even how to coordinate a collection of use cases for the entire targeted system being developed. For example, to model how the events in a single use case relate to one another - in particular, use cases where activities may overlap and require coordination.In this 

In this project, you are going to create UML activity diagram to visualize workflow of standard ATM functionality.


## What are you going to learn?

- UML activity diagram drawing based on a specification

## Tasks

1. Get familiarized with diagrams.net tool
    - Make sure you can reach and sign in diagrams.net site
    - Make sure that you understand the basics of tool

2. Activity diagram drawing for standard ATM process
    - Create activity diagram based on the attached ATM process specification dokument
    - Make sure you can reach attached ATM specification and do understand the written procces
    - Activity diagram has to be created based on documentations
    - All actions and their connections must be visualized in the final document

## General requirements

- Upload the diagram into the base repository
- Use the terminal and Git commands to upload your work to the base repository

## Hints
